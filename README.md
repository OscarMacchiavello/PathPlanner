Small project where Dijkstra's algorithm and a greedy algorithm are applied to find an efficient route between the starting point and the destination point, considering an arbitrary number of previous destinations in between.

The data are aggregated in the form of coordinates (latitude, longitude) in the initial interface of the program. The coordinates can be obtained from www.google.com/maps, www.openstreetmap.org or any similar app.
